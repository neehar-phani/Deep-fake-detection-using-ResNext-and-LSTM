Addressing the challenge of detecting deep fake videos in the digital era, this research work proposes a robust framework that utilizes LSTM and ResNeXt CNN networks. 
The study examines current approaches and models, emphasizing the need for more powerful techniques to identify complex deepfakes.
The suggested model offers a comprehensive method for deepfake detection by combining temporal context understanding from LSTM with spatial feature extraction from ResNeXt. 
This process leads to a comprehensive framework for identifying artificial manipulations in video content, involving dataset selection, pre-processing, model creation, and evaluation metric assessment. 
After extensive testing, the model demonstrates strong detection capabilities and high accuracy rates, marking a significant step forward in the fight against the spread of deep fake videos and the preservation of multimedia content integrity.
